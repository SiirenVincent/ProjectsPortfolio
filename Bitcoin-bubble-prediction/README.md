This repository contain notebook of bitcoin bubble prediction, bitcoin sentiments analysis and files for deployment and hosting.


The objective of this project was to analyze the Bitcoin data and  determine whether the price is currently  in a bubble or not.
Also get to know if the sentiment is positive or negative.

I used several libraries to achieve my objectives i.e EDA - Pandas and Matpotlib, Modelling using scikit learn.
